just a simple matrix multiplication

using a simple matrix multiplication method as taught in high school 

C ij = (A i1 . B 1j) + (A i2 . B 2j) + (A i3 + B 3j)

by creating a loop (nested for) to input data into an array variable. then multiplying it using a triple nested for to calculate the results of the matrix multiplication according to the specified index, then displaying the results of the calculation using the nested loop.
